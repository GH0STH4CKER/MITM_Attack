# Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Script

This Python script demonstrates a basic Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using ARP spoofing. It intercepts communication between a target machine and the gateway/router without their knowledge, allowing the attacker to monitor or manipulate traffic.

## Disclaimer

**This script is provided for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script for malicious intent is illegal and unethical. Be sure to adhere to ethical standards and legal regulations when using your programming skills.**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library (install using `pip install scapy`)

## Usage

1. Configure the `target_ip` and `gateway_ip` variables in the script with the appropriate IP addresses.

2. Run the script using the command:


3. The script will start intercepting and relaying traffic between the target and the gateway. To stop the attack, press `CTRL+C`.

## Important Note

- This script exploits ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to manipulate the target's ARP cache. It sends ARP replies to both the target and the gateway, tricking them into sending traffic to the attacker's machine.

- Unauthorized use of this script on networks you don't have explicit permission for is illegal and unethical.

## Legal Considerations

Please be aware that using this script without proper authorization may violate laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Always use your programming skills responsibly and ethically.
